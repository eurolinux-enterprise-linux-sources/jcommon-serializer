A list of changes in recent versions:

0.3.0: (30-May-2008)
        * Switched from JCommon to LibBase. All version information is now contained in
          the manifest. The Project-Info implementation reads the version numbers from
          the Jar's Manifest or the compiler-output-directory.

0.2.0: (01-Aug-2007)
        * [BUG] The initialization configuration file must be named after the
          library. The 'serializer.properties' file has been renamed into
          'jcommon-serializer.properties'.

0.1.0: (17-Apr-2006)
        * The first public release of this library.
